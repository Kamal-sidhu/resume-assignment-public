# Reflection on Resume Project created by kamaldeep kaur 

## 1. Can I explain what my code does?

This project is basically my online resume built using just HTML. It has all the important parts like About Me, Skills, Experience, Education, Projects, and Contact info — all laid out in a clean, simple way. I used semantic tags to keep everything organized and easy to read, and added images and links to make it look more professional. The goal was to create something that shows who I am and what I can do, in a clear and friendly way for anyone checking out my profile.This resume website uses semantic HTML, CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, Google Fonts for typography, and media queries for responsiveness.


## 2. What was my coding process?

I started by brainstorming what sections a good resume should have, then sketched out a rough plan of the layout. After that, I built the HTML structure step-by-step, adding content little by little. I saved often and tested the page locally in my browser to make sure everything showed up right, especially the images and links. Using Git helped me keep track of my progress and roll back if needed. It felt great seeing the page come together after each commit!

## 3. What challenges did I have?

At first, I struggled with getting my images to show up correctly. I kept using the full file path from my computer, which obviously didn’t work when I opened the page in a browser. I had to learn about relative paths and fix that. Another challenge was pushing my code to GitHub — I got stuck with authentication errors and permission denied messages, which was frustrating but I figured it out after reading some docs and resetting my remote. Also, deciding how to organize and format the content so it looked neat took more time than I expected.Started with cloning Assignment 1, added design guidelines, implemented CSS layout, then fonts, responsiveness, and accessibility.


## 4. What would I do differently now?

If I did this again, I’d probably spend more time planning my file and folder structure upfront to keep things tidy from the start. I’d also add some CSS earlier to make the design more polished and user-friendly, maybe even try a CSS framework like Bootstrap to speed things up. I want to learn how to make the page responsive so it looks good on phones too. And finally, I’d try to get my GitHub setup sorted earlier to avoid those annoying push errors — maybe even try SSH keys instead of HTTPS.
